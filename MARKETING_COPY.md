# DEFRAG Marketing Copy Standards

## The Golden Rule: Action Copy

All product descriptions must follow this 3-part structure:

1. **Definition**: This is a [tool/feature] for [who].
2. **Benefit**: It helps you [outcome].
3. **Mechanism**: It does this by [action].

## Voice & Tone

- **Mechanical**: Use engineering terms (friction, load, latency, protocol).
- **No Jargon**: Avoid "astrology", "healing", "vibration", "energy".
- **Infrastructure-First**: We build safety barriers for human systems.

## Examples

* **PlatformHub Hero**: "Safety Infrastructure for Human Systems."
- **Manuals**: "This is a user manual for your partner. It helps you side-step conflict. It does this by decoding their default operating mode."
- **Docs**: "This is the core manual for developers. It helps you build safety barriers. It does this by providing standard implementation patterns."
