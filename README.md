# DEFRAG OS v1.0 // TECHNICAL MANIFEST

**STATUS:** STABLE // **BUILD:** 0xFD-2024 // **AUTHORITY:** SYSTEM ARCHITECT

Standard relationship advice is software. It tells you to "be nicer" or "listen better." 
**DEFRAG deals in hardware.**

This application treats human nature as a dataset. It scrapes the universal backend (Planetary Geometry + Genetic Drivers) to provide clean, actionable Operating Manuals for difficult hardware (people).

---

## 1. SYSTEM TOPOLOGY: NOISE → SIGNAL → ACTION

The application follows a strictly linear topology designed to reduce emotional entropy:
- **NOISE:** Raw user input and chaotic interpersonal conflict.
- **SIGNAL:** Deterministic mapping of natal coordinates to mechanical profiles.
- **ACTION:** Deployment of specific engagement protocols and synthetic boundaries.

---

## 2. CORE MODULES

### 2.1 THE CODE SCRAPER (CORE ENGINE)
Input coordinates are processed via `defragEngine.ts`. The engine utilizes **Proprietary Ephemeris Hashing** to map manufacture coordinates to one of two primary hardware profiles:
- **THE DOER (Kinetic Generator):** High-voltage units that run on motion. Systems overheat when idle.
- **THE GUIDE (Projector):** Observation-based units. Systems shut down in high-noise environments.

### 2.2 THE NATAL ARCHIVE (PRO TIER)
Persistent data storage via `localStorage`. Profiles for targets (Boss, Partner, Parent) are stored as unique units within the OS, allowing for instant spec retrieval and dashboard monitoring.

### 2.3 ATMOSPHERIC FRICTION MONITOR
A real-time "weather report" for the nervous system. The monitor tracks planetary pressure (e.g., *Mars Square Pluto*) and issues advisories based on the active subject's natal hardware.

### 2.4 THE PROXY VOICE (EMERGENCY OVERRIDE)
A viral safety feature powered by the **Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS API**. When verbal communication fails, the Operator can deploy synthetic boundaries using the cold, robotic **Charon** voice to break emotional loops.

## 3. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

- **Frontend:** React 19 (ES6 Modules)
- **Intelligence Layer:** Google Gemini API
    - `gemini-3-flash-preview`: Generates structured industrial JSON manuals.
    - `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts`: Renders the synthetic robotic voice.
- **Environment:**
    - Variable: `process.env.API_KEY` (Required for Gemini access).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Custom CRT Overlays (Scanlines, Film Grain, Jitter).
- **Typography:** JetBrains Mono (Technical/Industrial) & Inter (UI).

---

## 4. VISUAL PROTOCOL (THE BRAND)

The UI adheres to a strict "IKEA Manual meets Cyberpunk Terminal" aesthetic:
1. **NO STOCK PHOTOS:** No "marketing fluff."
2. **HIGH CONTRAST:** Monochrome (Black/White/Grey).
3. **ALERT ORANGE:** HEX `#ea580c` is reserved exclusively for system signals and high-voltage warnings.
4. **CRT EFFECTS:** Scanline overlays and noise filters simulate an analog hardware interface.

---

## 5. OPERATION & HANDOFF

### API CONFIGURATION
The system is pre-configured to look for a single environment variable. Ensure this is set in your IDE or hosting environment:
- **Key:** `API_KEY`
- **Value:** [Your Google AI Studio API Key]

### LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start Vite dev server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

### DEPLOYMENT
DEFRAG is a pure frontend build. It can be deployed to any static hosting provider (Firebase, Vercel, Netlify). The `index.html` is the entry point.

---

## 6. DIAGNOSTIC LOG
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM (Simulated/Visual).
- **Latency:** Optimized for real-time TTS deployment.
- **Safety:** "The friction isn't personal. It's just unmanaged hardware."
