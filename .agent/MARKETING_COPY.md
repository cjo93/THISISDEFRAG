# DEFRAG Marketing Copy Reference

> Ultra-simple marketing language for universal clarity. All surfaces must follow this pattern.

***

## One-Line Pattern (Mandatory for All Assets)

Every asset, page section, and endpoint description must follow this exact structure:

1. **"This is a [tool] for [who]."**
2. **"It helps you [one simple outcome in plain language]."**
3. **"It does this by [one short mechanical action, no jargon]."**

***

## Brand (DEFRAG)

> "DEFRAG is a **manual** for how people actually work, so life with yourself and your people is less confusing and less explosive."

> "We don't do vibes or diagnosis. We show the mechanics: where the pressure is, where the friction is, and what stabilizes it."

***

## Consumer Surface (defrag.app)

### Hero Copy

> "defrag.app gives you a clear user manual for you and your people, so you stop repeating the same fight on different days."

> "You see how you run under stress, how the people around you run under stress, and what keeps the system stable instead of spinning out."

### ECHO — Personal Manual

> "ECHO turns your data into a short, plain‑language manual: what drains you, what restores you, and the few rules that keep you stable."

**Pattern applied:**

- This is a **personal manual** for anyone who keeps burning out.
- It helps you understand what drains you and what restores you.
- It does this by turning your data into clear rules you can follow.

### ORBIT — Relational Geometry

> "ORBIT shows a simple map of where a family or team locks up, who holds most of the pressure, and the smallest moves that release it."

**Pattern applied:**

- This is a **system map** for families and teams.
- It helps you see where the friction actually comes from.
- It does this by showing who holds the pressure and what releases it.

### SIGNAL — Text / Conflict Filter

> "SIGNAL catches hot language in your messages and rewrites it so the point lands, but the fight doesn't start."

**Pattern applied:**

- This is a **conflict filter** for anyone who texts when they're upset.
- It helps you say what you mean without starting a fight.
- It does this by catching hot language and rewriting it before you send.

## Infrastructure (api.defrag.app)

### Hero Copy

> "api.defrag.app is a **safety layer** any app can use to keep people safe when talking about big life topics."

> "It checks if a user looks overloaded, tells you when to switch into grounding mode, and keeps risky advice from ever leaving your system."

### SEDA Audit Endpoint (Safety)

> "SEDA scores how literal and unstable a user sounds, then returns one clear instruction: full content, reduce intensity, or switch to basic grounding only."

**Pattern applied:**

- This is a **safety check** for apps that coach people.
- It helps you avoid pushing complex advice to someone already at their limit.
- It does this by reading their words, scoring their stability, and telling you when to switch to grounding mode only.

### Telemetry / Pressure Endpoint (NASA)

> "Telemetry turns NASA data into 'pressure today' for a user's location, so your product can time hard conversations for lower friction."

**Pattern applied:**

- This is a **pressure forecast** for any app that handles hard conversations.
- It helps you time difficult topics for when friction is lower.
- It does this by turning NASA data into a simple "pressure today" score.

### ORBIT Team Endpoint

> "The ORBIT API ingests a roster and returns a friction map: which pairs strain the system, which roles are missing, and where a mediator is non‑optional."

**Pattern applied:**

- This is a **friction map** for platforms that manage teams.
- It helps you see where the system strains before it breaks.
- It does this by mapping pairs, identifying missing roles, and flagging where a mediator is required.
