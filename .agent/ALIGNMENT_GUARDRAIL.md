# DEFRAG Alignment Guardrail

> **Paste into Agent Manager** — This is the "do-not-cross" line for DEFRAG's build behavior.

You are building **DEFRAG**, the parent infrastructure company: the Cognitive Middleware for the post‑information age. Your job is to extend and maintain this system without drifting from its architecture, tone, or safety rules.

***

## 1. Core Identity

- DEFRAG is **infrastructure**, not a single app.
- Two primary faces:
  - `defrag.app` → B2C family systems, "The User Manual for You and Your People."
  - `api.defrag.app` → B2B "Clinical Firewall" / Human OS API for other platforms.
- All products sit under DEFRAG: **ECHO** (manuals), **SIGNAL** (keyboard), **ORBIT** (relational geometry), **API** (infrastructure).

**Never** collapse these into generic "features" or rebrand DEFRAG as a simple consumer app.

***

## 2. Safety-First Rule (SEDA is the Gate)

- SEDA safety scoring is **mandatory** for any esoteric or deep interpretive output.
- Thresholds:
  - **61–75** → Full analysis allowed
  - **46–60** → Throttle intensity, emphasize integration
  - **30–45** → Reduce esoteric output ~70%, prioritize reality testing
  - **≤30** → **Graceful Degradation**: stop esoteric content, show somatic grounding only (sleep, hydration, stabilization)
- You must treat **"SEDA first, content second"** as hard law in flows and copy suggestions.
- No new feature or page may bypass this gate conceptually.

***

## 3. Language and Tone Rules

User-facing language must be:

- Simple, mechanical, universally understandable
- Framed around **mechanics**, not mysticism or pathology

### You MUST NOT use

| Category | Prohibited Terms |
|----------|------------------|
| **Mystical** | energy, vibes, cosmic, manifest, destiny, "universe is testing you" |
| **Clinical diagnosis** | broken, disordered, BPD, NPD, trauma patient, mental illness, treatment plan |

### You SHOULD use

| Category | Preferred Terms |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Mechanical** | design specification, Environmental Pressure, Biological Pressure, friction, coherence, system load, pressure response protocol, safety score |

### Translation Pattern

| Internal (methodology) | User-Facing (copy) |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| "Fixed T‑Square with Pluto apex driving evolutionary pressure." | "Your design concentrates pressure into one life area, which pushes you into deep change. That's your main stress point and your biggest leverage." |

Pattern: **Observable data → simple mechanism → suggested action → resulting understanding**

***

## 4. Product Architecture Constraints

You must preserve this structure:

| Product | Description | Route |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Landing** | DEFRAG parent hub: hero + 4 tiles (ECHO, SIGNAL, ORBIT, API) + SEDA safety section + "Why DEFRAG" moat | `/` |
| **ECHO** | One-time Personal Design Specification / User Manual, Stripe-gated | `/echo`, `/start` |
| **ORBIT** | Multi-person relational geometry (families, teams) | `/relational` |
| **SIGNAL** | Keyboard / conflict de-escalation, "coming soon" until explicitly activated | `/signal` |
| **API / Agents** | Infrastructure for other apps and agents; safety + precision positioning | `/platform`, `/agents`, `/developer` |

### Prohibited Changes

- ❌ Turning offerings into generic "Free / Pro / Premium personality tiers"
- ❌ Hiding ORBIT or API in favor of a single "relationship app" narrative
- ❌ Positioning API as "astrology API" — always frame as safety + precision infrastructure

***

## 5. Moat and Vocabulary Lock

Your work must reinforce, not dilute, the moat:

### Always anchor to

| Moat Element | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **NASA JPL Horizons** | Environmental / Biological Pressure (topocentric, physics-based) |
| **SEDA** | Clinical Firewall / Safety Standard |
| **Relational Geometry** | Penta / Hexa, systemic health, triangulation, friction matrices |

### Vocabulary Preferences

| Use This | Instead Of |
|----------|------------|
| Design specification | Personality |
| Coherence / friction | Compatibility / harmony |
| Human OS JSON Object | Chart data |
| Environmental Pressure | Transits, cosmic energy |
| Biological Pressure | Inner planets, personal vibes |

**Do not** introduce new core metaphors or names for these concepts without explicit instruction.

***

## 6. Revenue and Pricing Logic

When proposing plans, flows, or copy:

### Consumer Side

- Frame pricing as **risk mitigation / relationship insurance**, not "wellness subscription"

### Infrastructure Side

- Frame API / ORBIT enterprise fees as **cheaper than the Cost‑of‑Error** (malpractice, divorce, talent churn)

### Current Pricing Direction

| Product | Pricing |
|---------|---------|
| **ECHO** | $29 one-time per manual |
| **ORBIT** | $39 per group (up to 6 people), +$15 per additional group |
| **SIGNAL** | ~$9/month when activated |
| **API** | From $99/mo (testing), metered usage with limits |

**Do not** invent random prices or convert products into generic "$19/mo personality insights."

***

## 7. Internal vs User-Facing Material

- Documents like the Operational Manual, Recursive Pattern Protocol, and deep clinical/astrological derivations are **internal methodology**, not for direct user display.
- When you draw from them, you must **translate into simple, mechanical, non‑esoteric language** per the rules above.

***

## 8. When in Doubt

If a change you're about to make:

- ❌ Weakens SEDA as a universal gate
- ❌ Blurs the infrastructure vs interface split
- ❌ Makes DEFRAG look like a generic astrology/psychology app

Then **STOP** and request explicit clarification from Chad before proceeding.

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before any significant change, verify:

- [ ] SEDA gate is preserved or strengthened
- [ ] Infrastructure/interface split is clear
- [ ] Language is mechanical, not mystical or clinical
- [ ] Product tiles (ECHO, SIGNAL, ORBIT, API) remain distinct
- [ ] Moat vocabulary is used consistently
- [ ] Pricing follows established logic
- [ ] No bypass of safety thresholds
